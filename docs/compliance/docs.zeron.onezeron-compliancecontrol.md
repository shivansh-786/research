# Control
On the Controls page, the user can view the controls which belong to multiple domains 
Controls are prescriptive, actionable measures designed to mitigate identified risks and ensure conformance with legal, regulatory, contractual, or internal policy requirements. Within the SCF structure, controls serve as the tactical layer that bridges abstract compliance obligations (e.g., ISO 27001 clauses) with concrete operational activities 
Each control typically defines the “what” and “how” aspects of a requirement—specifying the necessary technologies, processes, or behaviors that must be in place. Controls are mapped across multiple standards to promote reusability and efficiency in multi-framework compliance initiatives. Their proper implementation and regular evaluation are essential to maintaining an effective security and compliance program 
Multiple controls can belong to a singular domain 
The controls on this page are not Framework Specific
