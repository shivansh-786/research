# Findings
The findings page presents detailed information on findings, with options to sort and filter based on categories, severity levels, and asset-specific criteria. Users can view findings by different categories, and perform searches to locate specific entries
At the start of the page, we have the total number of findings, which is followed by the number of vulnerabilities based on the severity 
**We can filter our Findings based on the following categories :**
  * Vulnerabilities 
  * Incident History
  * Application Security 
  * Cloud Security 
  * Access Control Risks 
  * Network Security 


**Below that, we have the findings with the following headers :**
  * **Category -** the category to which the finding belongs to
  * **Findings -** the name of the finding found 
  * **Asset count -** the number of assets to back up the finding 
  * **CVSS Score -** The CVSS score quantifies the severity of a vulnerability in an information system, providing a standardized measure for assessing potential risk, with a range from 0 to 10 
  * **Likelihood of Exploitability -** Likelihood of Exploitability is a score, ranging from 0 to 1, that indicates the probability of a specific vulnerability being exploited relative to others 
  * **Risk Score -** Risk Score is the function of a CVSS score and the Likelihood of Exploitability, representing a combined measure of both the severity of a vulnerability and its likelihood of being exploited, with a range of 0 to 10 
  * **Risk Severity -** the impact of the risk on the organization
