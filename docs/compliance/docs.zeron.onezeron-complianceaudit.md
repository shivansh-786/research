On the Audit page, users can view the audits created by the organization 
Audits are formal, systematic evaluations of an organization’s policies, controls, and processes to determine the extent to which they comply with internal standards, regulatory requirements, and recognized best practices. They serve as a critical governance mechanism for ensuring accountability, transparency, and continuous improvement within the cybersecurity and compliance programs
Audits may be internal—conducted by the organization’s own compliance or risk management teams—or external, carried out by independent third-party auditors or regulatory bodies. The scope of an audit can vary widely, ranging from focused assessments (e.g., access control reviews) to full-scale evaluations against frameworks 
**During an audit, auditors typically :**
  * Review policies and procedures to ensure they are formally documented, approved, and aligned with applicable frameworks 
  * Evaluate control design and implementation to confirm that safeguards are in place and operating as intended.
  * Examine evidence artifacts to verify that activities (such as risk assessments, access reviews, and incident responses) are being executed and documented 


Audit findings may include observations, non-conformities, or recommendations. These are usually followed by a remediation plan and, in some cases, corrective action reports (CARs) to close identified gaps. Successful audits enhance stakeholder confidence and demonstrate the organization’s commitment to robust governance, risk management, and compliance practices
