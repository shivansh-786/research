# Manage Framework and Domains
On the Manage Framework and Domains Page, the user can view the "Available Frameworks" that have been added to the added platform as per their request beforehand 
Frameworks are structured sets of standards, guidelines, and best practices developed to help organizations systematically manage governance, risk, and compliance objectives. They serve as the foundational layer for building secure, resilient, and audit-ready systems by translating broad regulatory and industry requirements into actionable controls
Frameworks are typically developed by recognized bodies (e.g., ISO, NIST, CSA, PCI) and can focus on various areas such as information security, privacy, data protection, and operational risk. **They offer a repeatable model for achieving and demonstrating compliance, enabling organizations to :**
  * Standardize control implementation across departments and systems
  * Map obligations across multiple regulatory regimes (via crosswalks like the SCF)
  * Benchmark security maturity and risk posture
  * Satisfy audit, legal, and customer due diligence requirements


The Requested Frameworks are added by our team based on the user's request and use

Domains are also present on this page. We have 33 domains as per the SCF Framework 
Domains are umbrella terms that help an organization look into multiple sectoral controls and their implementation 
Domains are thematic groupings of controls within a framework or control architecture (like SCF). They represent major functional or risk areas of governance, security, and compliance, helping to break down complex frameworks into manageable and logical sections 
Each domain houses a collection of controls related to a specific area of concern. **This modular structure enables organizations to :**
  * Assign ownership and responsibility at a domain level (e.g., “Access Management” to the IT team)
  * Perform focused risk assessments and audits
  * Track maturity and remediation progress by functional category 


Under a domain, multiple controls are mapped to a domain for the organization to adapt to
