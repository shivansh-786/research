Step 4 - Creating a Custom Template (Optional)[](https://docs.zeron.one/how-the-magic-happens#step-4-creating-a-custom-template-optional)

This sample template gives you the flexibility to upload the questions with proper well-defined categories straight from your sheets to the platform. It also includes instructions for the user 
![](https://docs.zeron.one/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F1956480574-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FUuBdNVlAow8f9cZKicFF%252Fuploads%252FqxoHWMmQ9vZJZTWt6TK1%252FScreenshot%25202025-02-26%2520at%252012.43.53%25E2%2580%25AFPM.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3Def53a17d-1731-4f15-9fa0-1337a808de98&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=211957f3&sv=2)
**It includes the following attributes :**
**Question -** This is the title of the questions that you want to ask the vendors 
**Type -** The type of question it is, either single choice or text-based
**Mandatory/Optional -** This tells if the question is Mandatory or Optional 
**Weightage -** The weightage of the question. If not provided then "0" means no risk 
**Options (Comma Separated Options) -** If the question type is a single choice, then the list of options is separated by commas 
**Evidence Required On Question -** If the question requires evidence, then either "yes" or "no." Default value "No" if nothing is selected 
**Options Required Evidence (Use same option Value From Option Column) -** If the question type is a single choice, specify which options you want the vendor to provide the evidence 
**High-Risk Options (Use same option Value From Option Column) -** Comma-separated options from the "Options" column that indicate high risk (e.g., "No Training Conducted" for employee security training). Leave blank if none 
**Medium Risk Options (Use same option Value From Option Column) -** Comma-separated options from the "Options" column that indicate medium risk (e.g., "Training Conducted Once a Year" for employee security training). Leave blank if none 
**Low-Risk Options (Use same option Value From Option Column) -** Comma-separated options from the "Options" column that indicate low risk (e.g., "Training Conducted Quarterly" for employee security training). Leave blank if none 
**Organization Remark Required On Vendor Answer -** If set to "Yes," the organization can provide remarks for each vendor's answer. These remarks can be marked as Compliant, Partially-Compliant, Non-Compliant, or Not-Applicable. If not selected then the default value is No
**Evidence Name -** The prompt used for showcasing the evidence on text-based questions with the default "Please enter evidence"

While filling out the sample template, the user has the decision to choose the type of question between either Text or Single Choice. In Text, the user can fill in answers for the assessment in texts using their own words in a text field. In Single Choice, the user can only choose one option from the multiple options available 
Furthermore, the user has the freedom to choose whether a question is Mandatory or Optional. If it is Mandatory, it must be answered. If it is Optional, it can be skipped. The user also decides which options would be High, Medium, or Low severity, if they were to occur to an organization in real time. Additionally, the user also can add weightage to a question to create a risk
The user also mentions the options that are viable for the question, and these options need to be separated using commas to distinguish them. The user can also choose whether evidence is needed for the question. To further smoothen the experience, the user can also decide on which options the evidence is required, as not every option might need justification in the form of evidence. The user also has the authority to choose the severity of the options, i.e., High, Medium, or Low. Through this, we get a more apt understanding of how critical of a risk it potentially could be
Additionally, if the question type is free text, the user can enable an option that mandates vendors to upload evidence for that question. If there is a weightage assigned to the question, the organization can select “Organization Remark Required On Vendor Answer.” After reviewing the answer and uploading evidence, the organization can determine whether a risk should be created based on the response 
**For a Text-based question, consider the following example :**
The organization asks vendors to “Describe your data encryption policies.” This question is of Text type, meaning vendors must provide a free-text response instead of selecting from predefined options. Since encryption policies are critical for security compliance, this question is marked as Mandatory and has a Weightage of 10, indicating its importance in the risk assessment. As a free-text response, the Options column is marked as N/A (not applicable) 
Additionally, evidence is required for this question, ensuring that vendors submit supporting documents such as encryption policy files. The Organization Review is enabled, meaning the organization’s risk team will evaluate the response and uploaded evidence before determining whether a risk should be created. The required evidence document for submission is labeled as “Encryption_Policy_Document”
**For a Single Choice question, consider the following example :**
The organization asks vendors, “Does your company have an incident response plan?” This question is of Single Choice type, meaning vendors must select one option from the given choices: Yes, No, or In Progress. Since incident response plans are essential for risk management, the question is Mandatory and has a Weightage of 5.
**To ensure proper documentation, vendors are required to upload evidence only if they select “Yes” or “In Progress” as their answer. The risk severity is classified as follows :**
“No” is considered High Risk, as lacking an incident response plan could severely impact the organization
“In Progress” is classified as Medium Risk, since the company is working on implementing a plan but has not yet finalized it
“Yes” is categorized as Low Risk, as the company already has a response plan in place 
Unlike the text-based question, the Organization Review is not required for this question, meaning the risk assessment is based on predefined severity levels. The required document for evidence submission is labeled as “Incident_Response_Document” 
**Step 5 - Creating an Assessment**[](https://docs.zeron.one/how-the-magic-happens#step-5-creating-an-assessment)
After choosing the template we want to create an assessment, we have to choose the vendor 
By going to that specific vendor's page, go to the Assessment Process and click on "Create Assessment". **The following information is needed to be filled out :**
**Assessment Name -** A concise, descriptive title that uniquely identifies each assessment, providing clarity and ease of reference within the assessment system
**Choose Template for Vendor -** A selection option allowing users to choose a predefined template for vendor assessment, streamlining the setup process with consistent criteria
**Assessment Scheduled Date -** Specifies the date by which the assessment will be sent to the vendor
**Assessment Scheduling Intervals -** The designated time between two consecutive assessments or evaluations, determining how frequently they are scheduled to occur
**Assessment Due Date -** Specifies the deadline by which the assessment must be completed, ensuring timely responses and adherence to evaluation schedules
S**ubmission Deadline Duration -** Specifies the deadline by which the assessment must be completed, ensuring timely responses and adherence to evaluation schedules

An email is sent to the Vendor's SPOC to complete the Assessment
