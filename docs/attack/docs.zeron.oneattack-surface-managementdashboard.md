# Dashboard
The dashboard for Attack Surface Management provides a comprehensive and accurate yet diverse display of some of the most important metrics in assessing the external risks to an organization. **Those metrics are as follows :**
  * **Total Discovered Assets -** Total number of assets associated with vendors, including systems, applications, and infrastructure components 
  * **WAF -** Web Application Firewall (WAF) status and configurations for web assets to protect against threats 
  * **Likelihood of Exploitation -** The estimated probability of vulnerabilities being exploited within the assets 
  * **Asset Inventory -** A comprehensive list of assets connected, including software, hardware, and data resources 
  * **Risk Score -** The calculated risk level for assets, based on vulnerability severity, impact, and likelihood of exploitation 
  * **Vulnerabilities Found -** Total number of assets associated with vendors, including systems, applications, and infrastructure components 
  * **Exposed Ports -** Ports that are exposed to external networks. These may pose security risks if misconfigured
  * **Technology Stack -** Details about the technology stack being used. Includes frameworks and platforms in use
  * **Lookalike Domains -** Domains that appear similar to the original domain. Often used in phishing attacks
  * **Exposed Cloud Findings -** Findings related to exposed cloud services or data. Highlights improperly secured assets 
  * **Discovered Github Patches -** Patches discovered in Github repositories. Indicates ongoing efforts to resolve issues
  * **Discovered Docker Images -** Docker images found in repositories. May contain sensitive or outdated configurations
  * **Discovered Gitlab Patches -** Patches discovered in Gitlab repositories. Indicates ongoing efforts to resolve issues 
  * **Discovered Bitbucket Patches -** Patches discovered in Bitbucket repositories. Indicates ongoing efforts to resolve issues
  * **Top 5 High-Risk Assets -** The Top 5 High-Risk Assets refer to the critical assets within an organization that pose the greatest level of risk to its security, operations, or compliance. These assets are identified based on factors such as vulnerabilities, exposure to threats, and their potential impact on the organization's objectives 
  * **Top 5 High-Risk Category -** Threatwise Asset Classification of the top categories which have the highest risk 
  * The user also gets a glance at the number of discovered vulnerabilities organized into categories like Info, Low, Medium, High, and Critical. These categories are made on the severity of the vulnerability and how much damage it would cause the organization

Choosing Dahsboard for a Specific Target [](https://docs.zeron.one/attack-surface-management/dashboard#choosing-dahsboard-for-a-specific-target)
The user can also choose to change the dashboard interface for a specific target by selecting the target from the top right corner 
![](https://docs.zeron.one/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2188191365-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FvBTycUWdqgwj8eprXRzN%252Fuploads%252FKMaDeXR3rPqG8SvkEIgI%252FScreenshot%25202025-02-18%2520at%252012.47.04%25E2%2580%25AFPM.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D6d2f8318-e05d-43ac-8858-f645891156ac&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=5a642526&sv=2)
The dashboard changes as soon as I choose a different target

Adding a Target to the Dashbaord [](https://docs.zeron.one/attack-surface-management/dashboard#adding-a-target-to-the-dashbaord)
The user can also add a target whose metrics are to be presented on the dashboard. Just simply click on the "Add Target" button on the bottom right 
![](https://docs.zeron.one/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2F2188191365-files.gitbook.io%2F%7E%2Ffiles%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FvBTycUWdqgwj8eprXRzN%252Fuploads%252F7gASrrhXWMC8GZRUrvNU%252FScreenshot%25202025-02-18%2520at%252012.53.32%25E2%2580%25AFPM.png%3Falt%3Dmedia%26token%3D9dfb1147-b9a1-40e6-b216-92bb2a8de6a1&width=300&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=2e49941a&sv=2)
Now the user just needs to add the domain of the target
