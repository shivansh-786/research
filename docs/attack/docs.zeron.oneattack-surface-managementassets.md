# Assets
The assets page provides detailed information about assets, featuring sorting and filtering options to view them by type, status (active or inactive), and WAF exposure (exposed or protected). Users can also perform searches to locate specific assets quickly. The interface is designed to help manage and analyze asset data effectively, ensuring that critical information is easily accessible. Organizing assets in this way supports better decision-making and risk management. **It includes the following :**
  * **Total Discovered -** Total number of assets associated with vendors, including systems, applications, and infrastructure components 
  * **WAF -** Web Application Firewall (WAF) status and configurations for web assets to protect against threats 
  * **Category of Assets -** multiple categories that the assets are divided into
