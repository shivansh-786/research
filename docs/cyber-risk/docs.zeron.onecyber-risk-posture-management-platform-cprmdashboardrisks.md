# Risks
**The risks faced by the organization are majorly categorized into two, based on the severity of the risk :**
  * Critical
  * Medium

**Critical** [](https://docs.zeron.one/cyber-risk-posture-management-platform-cprm/dashboard/risks#critical)
This section displays the number of critical events having a severity level in the range of 11-15. It also has a mini graph of all the events, which can be expanded by clicking on the full-screen icon present in the bottom right corner

On expanding, the user can get a chart view and a tabular view. The chart view shows a graph that maps the event count at particular time intervals. Through this the users can getr a better idea of when the compromise took place

The tabular view contains the data which makes up the graph. This has a table containing five subsections for recording each event, namely: date, host, MITRE ATT&CK type, severity level, rule, and description. The total number of events recorded can be seen in the bottom center of the tabular data view
