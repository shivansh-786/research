# Key Performance Indicators (KPI)
**Zeron provides the user with a smooth overview of the organization’s overall security using 3 KPI (Key Performance Indicator) metrics :**
**Z Score**[](https://docs.zeron.one/cyber-risk-posture-management-platform-cprm/dashboard/key-performance-indicators-kpi#z-score)
The 'Z score' refers to the overall security score of the organization. A high _'Z score'_ points to a more secure environment 
**Breach Probability**[](https://docs.zeron.one/cyber-risk-posture-management-platform-cprm/dashboard/key-performance-indicators-kpi#breach-probability)
The 'Breach Probability' presents the user with the likelihood of a data breach occurring depending upon the Security Configuration Assessment. This score ranges from 0 to 1, where a low score ensures higher security
**Compliance Score**[](https://docs.zeron.one/cyber-risk-posture-management-platform-cprm/dashboard/key-performance-indicators-kpi#compliance-score)
The compliance score demonstrates how compliant the organization’s security is with respect to different compliance frameworks/ regulations. **The frameworks/regulations supported by Zeron are :**
**GDPR**
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a Regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the EU and the European Economic Area 
**PCI DSS**
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a global standard created for protecting credit and payment card data and transactions 
**NIST**
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a set of guidelines for mitigating organizational cybersecurity risks, published by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (Hence, NIST) 
**ISO 27001**
ISO/IEC 27001 is an international standard used for managing information security. 
**HIPAA**
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is an american compliance framework created to protect sensitive patient health information 
**SOC2**
SOC2 is a voluntary compliance standard for service organizations, developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) 
The value of the compliance score is given as the mean value of all the scores received from each Compliance framework enabled. A high compliance score shows higher security.
