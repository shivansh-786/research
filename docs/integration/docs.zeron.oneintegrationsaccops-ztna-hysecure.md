This document outlines how to integrate the ZERON platform with Accops HySecure (ZTNA Gateway) using HySecureâ€™s APIs to collect user information and endpoint IP addresses. **The integration focuses solely on retrieving :**
  * Registered Users from the ZTNA system 
  * Active Users with their associated endpoint WAN IP addresses 


No logs or event data will be collected 
**Authentication and Credential Setup**[](https://docs.zeron.one/integrations/accops-ztna-hysecure#authentication-and-credential-setup)
  * **Creating API Credentials :**
    * **Step 1 -** Log into HySecure Management Console as a Security Officer or Administrator

      * **Role -** Monitoring User 
      * **Password -** <StrongPassword!123>
    * **Step 4 -** Enable the user and optionally select "Password never expires"


  * **Required Permissions :**
    * **Minimum Role -** Monitoring User 
    * **Required access rights :**
      * View Registered Users 
      * View Active Users/Sessions 


  * **Testing the Credentials :**


Copy```
curl -k -u "zeron_api:StrongPassword!123" https://<HySecure-IP>/monitor/active_users.csv -o active_users.csv
```

  * **Expected -** A downloadable CSV with currently active sessions and endpoint IPs
