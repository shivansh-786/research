On the Policy page, users can view the Policies created by the organization
Policies are formalized, management-approved statements that articulate the organizationâ€™s intent, principles, and rules governing information security and privacy. They define the behavioral and procedural expectations for personnel, systems, and third-party entities, ensuring consistent and enforceable practices 
A well-defined policy framework supports the implementation of controls by providing governance-level direction, setting thresholds for acceptable risk, and ensuring alignment with legal and regulatory mandates. Policies are typically tiered (e.g., enterprise, departmental, and procedural levels) and are subject to regular review and approval to remain relevant and effective 
These policies are mapped to individual controls
