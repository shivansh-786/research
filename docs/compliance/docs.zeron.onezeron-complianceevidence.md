# Evidence
On the Evidence page, users can view the evidence created by the organization 
Evidence consists of verifiable documentation, records, or system artifacts that demonstrate the implementation and operational effectiveness of a control. Evidence is a critical component of audit readiness and regulatory assurance, serving as proof that the organization’s policies and controls are not only defined but are actively enforced and maintained 
Examples of evidence include—but are not limited to—access logs, configuration files, training completion certificates, risk assessments, incident response reports, screenshots, and system-generated audit trails. The collection and organization of evidence should be systematic and aligned with the SCF’s Evidence Request List (ERL), which standardizes evidence expectations for internal assessments and third-party audits
