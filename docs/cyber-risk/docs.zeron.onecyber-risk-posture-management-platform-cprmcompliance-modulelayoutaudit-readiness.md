# Audit Readiness
Zeron provides a list of Evidence tasks that are to be presented during an Audit. The evidence tasks applicable to the organization can be enabled and assigned to an employee of the organization 
These evidence tasks can be searched according to their names, assignee, department (of the assignee), and frameworks they comply with. The _'Reset'_ button helps restore the search to the original setting
